Research outputs from my time at the Brain Tool Laboratory. 

String localizer data collection code requires Matlab, Arduino, and Universal Reader Assistant. For URA, I set gen 2 communication settings as optimal for estimated tags in field (1), maximized the power, and added antenna number, phase, and frequency to recorded parameters before toggling the TCP stream and starting the read.
